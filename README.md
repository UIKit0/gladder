What is Glower?
===============

Glower is a WebGL framework, written in JavaScript. Glower is...

* ... low-level, even more so than [GLOW](http://i-am-glow.com/). You need to know WebGL to use it.
* ... thin. So thin, in fact, that Glower objects can be used in raw WebGL calls directly.
* ... light. It has no dependencies, other than WebGL itself.
* ... flexible. It tries to make as few assumptions about your application as possible.
* ... unobtrusive. It does not change default behaviour of anything.
* ... cross-browser. It abstracts away browser differences.

Glower is not...

* ... a scene graph. You can build your own on top of it, if you like.
* ... a 3D library. It does not know anything about model loading, for example.
* ... a game engine.
